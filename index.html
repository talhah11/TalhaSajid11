        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Talha Sajid, currently in my 4th semester in Computer Science. <br>
        I'm from an A levels background, and I've always been curious about how Operating Systems work. <br>
        In this Assignment I was able to work on an Operating system and this Website's the Front end for that, I hope you like it.

            <h3>C/C++</h3>
            <p>Programming's something I love doing since forever, although I'm pretty decent at languages such as python and java my go to programming languages would always be C/C++.
            I've done some fair amount of work using C/C++, the most recent one being a Dictionary app with more than 4000 words and their meanings in it's database.

            <h3>Databases</h3>
            <p>With keen knowledge of MySql, and some past experience at working with databases, I can say that I'm pretty good at managing Databases. I worked on a Library management system a couple months ago, and it turned out to be excellent.</p>
