    <li>First Of all we created a Linux image using Docker.<br>
    <h3>What is Docker?</h3>
        Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
        Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
        With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
        By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly,
        you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.</li>
    <br>
    <li>We created a docker image using <b>docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv</b></li>
    <br>
    <li>Different Files Of Our OS are as follow:
    <ol>
        <li>The <b>header.asm</b> file contained all the data that was to be included in operating system binary.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Our operating system's entry point was the <b>Main.asm</b> file.
            We built a stack in it to store all of the data from the local function calls.
            It also aided in the execution of c code that dealt with all stack manipulation data.
            We tested for multiboot, CPU id (to see if the CPU supports long mode),
            and then long mode to switch our kernel operating system to 64 bit mode.
            Page tables were also built inside main.asm file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The <b>Linker.ld</b> file explained how to connect our operating systems.
            We specified the entry point and all parts of our binary in this file, setting the current address to 1 megabyte,
            which means that our operating system will start with 1 megabyte of data.
            The first section of the binary file was boot, which contained the multiboot header,
            and the second section was text, which contained all of our CPU instructions.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>We specified the grub.cfg file in order to generate the final iso file,
            and we were looking for <b>kernel.bin</b> in the boot folder.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In <b>Make file</b>, We generated two variables in the make file that contained all of the source and object files in src/impl/x86 64/boot.
            Following that, we specified the commands for converting our object files to source files.
            In addition, we created a directory to store our compiled file.The assembly software was compiled using Nasm.
            We wrote a custom command build-x86 64 after writing the code for compiling the file,
            which ran when only our object file was modified. We made a directory to save our iso file in. Finally,
            we produced our iso file with the grub rescue command.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Our operating system was converted to 64-bit mode using the <b>Main64.asm</b> file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The foreground colour, background colour, and text to be displayed on the screen was included in the <b>Main.c</b> file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>A header file called <b>Print.h</b> was used to build some methods and an enum of colours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The <b>Print.c</b> file included a custom print functions (with the help of them we printed SEECS), as well as some related methods.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>In the end, we ran qemu for simulating our operating system through the command
        <b>qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso</b></li>
</ul>
